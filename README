Slurm is used for distributed parallel computing.
- https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html

This repository is meant as an introduction to containerized use of Slurm.

Build and start containers:
  $ docker-compose up -d

Open interactive shell in submit-container:
  $ docker exec -it submit bash

Run test from within container:
  root@submit:/share# ./run_test.sh

Copy your own work files to the container:
  $ docker cp <file> submit:/share/<destination>

Shared volumes:
  /etc/munge/ - Contains a shared key for communication between containers.
  /share/     - Work files that are shared during execution.
